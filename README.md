## News
- [2025/02/21] paper is released at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13986). 
- [2025/02/06] first release, dataset, main architecture.

## Preprocessing 
The preprocessing code is now available in a [separate repository](https://github.com/DominicoRyu/SfSpp_preprocessing/tree/main)

## How to run
### Docker
1. Build docker images
```
    docker build -t sfs:latest .
```
3. Download Dataset
```
./download.sh
```
4. Choose one of the experiments commented out at *data_path.h*. 
5. Run docker container
```
./setup_container.sh
```
- You might have to change `--volume="/Dataset:/Dataset" \` at line 20 according to your dataset path

6. Build with cmake file
```
## Command at container ##
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release 

make
```
7. Run and press *spacebar* to see the result

### Windows 
1. Install requirements using [VCPKG](https://vcpkg.io/en/).
	* Manifest mode
        - Create `vcpkg.json` in the same directory as `CMakeList.txt`
        ```
        {
            "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/vcpkg-tool/main/docs/vcpkg.schema.json",
            "name": "base-agnostic",
            "version": "0.1.0",
            "dependencies": [
                {"name": "ceres", "features":["cxsparse", "eigensparse", "lapack", "suitesparse", "tools"]},
                {"name": "pcl", "features": ["visualization", "vtk", "tools"]}
            ]
        }
        ```
2. Configure and build with CMAKE (for more detail check [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/consume/manifest-mode?tabs=cmake%2Cbuild-cmake))
```
cmake -B build -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=%VCPKG_ROOT%\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake
```
- Change `VCPKG_ROOT` accordingly. (usually at C:\src\vcpkg or C:\dev\vcpkg)
- Build through CMAKE command (`cmake --build build`) or VS studio
3. Download Dataset
```
bash ./download.sh
```
4. Choose one of the experiments commented out at *data_path.h*. 
5. Run main.cpp and press *spacebar* to see the result

## Parameters
Data path : Path of the input data set  

	data_path.h
	string path = "/Dataset/"; 

Beam-search parameters : TOP_k indicates the *k*-top ranked beams being brought to the next iteration and BRANCHE_b indicates *b* branches expanding to search for more possible paths in each iteration. (Combinations of (k, b) as (5, 3), (10,5), and (20,10) are recommended)

	main.cpp
	TOP_k : 5
	BRANCH_b : 3

Number of CPU Thread : The number of CPU thread utilizing in *OpenMP* and *ceres solver*.
	
	data_structure.h
	NUMBER_OF_THREAD : 16

Ceres solver function tolerance : ceres hyper-parameter for convergence. We recommend to use the same or a lower value than 1.0e-6. For more details check [here](http://ceres-solver.org/nnls_solving.html). 

	reconstruction.h
	CERES_FUNC_TOL : 1.0e-3

MINIMUM_NUMBER : The minimum number of points on the edge line  to be considered in the calculation.

	reconstruction.h
	MINIMUM_NUMBER : 6

Counting inliers threshold : In order to evaluate ranking, we counted the number of inliers of that distance is less than this value. (Range 1-2 is recommended)

	reconstruction.h
	INLIER_THRESHOLD : 1.5

## Keyboard events
To visualize the results, several keyboard events are defined below. 

|Keyboard|Description|
|:---:|:---|
|'spacebar'| To show first ranked result|
|'->'| Move on lower ranked result|
|'<-'|Move on higer ranked result|
|'o' |Turn on/off OBJ|
|'s'|Save result|
|'g'| Save transformation matrix|
|'f'|Compute accuracy |


Pressing `s` button will save current state of data at `Dataset/Result/` including `edge-line` and `obj`.
